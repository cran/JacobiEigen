# Introduction

### The Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm

This is a classical algorithm proposed by the mathematician C. G. J. Jacobi in 1846 in connexion with some astronomical computations.  See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_eigenvalue_algorithm) for a detailed description and some historical references.

The method was computationally tedious, and remained dormant until the advent of modern computers in the mid 20th century.  Since its re-discovery it has been refined and improved many times, though much faster algorithms have since been devised and implemented.

I first met the Jacobi algorithm as an early `Fortran` programming exercise I had as a student in 1966.  It's simplicity and ingenuity fascinated me then and kindled an interest in numerical computations of this kind that has remained ever since.  It was a very good way to learn programming.

### Parallel revival

There has been some renewed interest in Jacobi-like methods in recent times, however, since unlike the faster methods for eigensolution computations, it offers the possibility of parallelisation.  See, for example, [Zhou and Brent](http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb207.pdf) for one possibility, and others in the references therein.

### Purpose of this package

This is a __demonstration package__ used for teaching purposes.  It's main purposes are to provide an example of an intermediate-level programming task where an efficient coding in pure `R` and one using in `C++` using `Rcpp` are strikingly similar.  The task also involves matrix manipulation in _pure_ `Rcpp`, rather than using `RcppArmadillo` for example, which is of some teaching interest as well.  

There are some situations where the `C++` function provided, `JacopiCpp`, can be slightly faster than the in-built `eigen` function in the `base` package, mainly for large numbers of small symmetric matrices.   Persons with a fascination for old algorithms might find the comparison with modern versions and alternatives interesting, but generally the functions are __not intended for production use__.

If someone is motivated to take up the challenge of producing a fast parallel Jacobi algorithm coding in R and provide it as a package, there may well be much practical interest (and this package will have served a useful practical purpose, if somewhat vicariously).

# Brief synopsis of the algorithm 

Let $S$ be a $2\times2$ symmetric matrix, with entries $s_{ij}$.  It it well known that any symmetric matrix may be diagonalized by an orthogonal similarity transformation. In symbols, for this special case, this implies we need to choose a value for $\theta$ for which:
$$ H^{\mathsf{T}} S H = 
\left[\begin{array}{lr}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta 
\end{array} \right]
\left[\begin{array}{lr}
s_{11} & s_{12} \\
s_{21} & s_{22} 
\end{array} \right]
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
\cos \theta & \sin \theta \\
-\sin \theta & \cos \theta 
\end{array} \right]
=
\left[\begin{array}{lr}
\lambda_1 & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 
\end{array} \right]  \; \overset{\mathrm{def.}}{=} \; \Lambda
$$
A solution is easily shown to be
$$
\theta = \begin{cases}
{ \frac12}\arctan\left(\frac{2s_{12}}{s_{22} - s_{11}}\right) & \mbox{if } s_{11} \neq s_{22} \\
 {\frac{\pi}4}& \mbox{if  }s_{11} = s_{22}
 \end{cases}
 $$
Note that both cases can be accommodated via the `R` function `atan2`.

In the general case a series of rotation matrices is chosen and applied successively.  These have teh same form as the $2\times2$ case, but embedded in an $n\times n$ identity matrix, so the application of any one of them affects two rows and columns _only_.  Such _planar rotation matrices_ are chosen so that at any stage the off-diagonal element with _maximum_ absolute value is anihilated.

Hence if at some stage $|s_{ij}|, \; (i<j)$, is maximum, the planar rotation matrix $H_{ij}$ will affect rows and columns $i$ and $j$ only, and will transform $s_{ij}$ to zero, and the process continues.

The process ceases when the $\underset{i<j}{\max}|s_{ij}| < \epsilon$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is some small pre-set tolerance.[^1]

[^1]: If only eigenvalues are required, the tolerance can be set somewhat higher than if accurate eigenvectors are required as well.  

Elements that are anihilated at some stage may become non-zero at later stages, of course, but several properties of the algorithm are guaranteed, namely

- At any stage the sum of squares of the off-diagonal elements is reduced, eventually to zero, and
- The rate of convergence is quadratic, so the algorithm is _relatively_ quick.

At the end of the algorithm, the original symmetric matrix $S$ is transformed into the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, $\Lambda$. If eigenvectors are also required then the accumulated product of the planar rotation matrices, starting with the identity, provide a normalized version of them:
$$
H = H_{i_p,j_p} \cdots H_{i_3,j_3}H_{i_2,j_2}H_{i_1,j_1}I_n
$$

# Examples

For a simple example, consider finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a well-known correlation matrix.
```{r, comment = ""}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(JacobiEigen)
library(stats)

imod <- aov(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) ~ Species, iris)
(R <- cor(resid(imod)))

rEig <- JacobiR(R) 
cEig <- Jacobi(R)
identical(rEig, cEig)  ## the R and Rcpp implementations are identical
cEig
(eEig <- eigen(R))
all.equal(eEig$values, cEig$values)  ## eigenvalues are (practically) identical
crossprod(eEig$vectors, cEig$vectors) %>% ## eigenvectors differ in signs
  round(10) 
```
We can now look at some timings.

```{r, comment = ""}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(JacobiR(R), Jacobi(R), eigen(R))
```
The apparene advantage of `Jacobi` rapidly diminishes as the size of the matrix increases:

```{r, comment = ""}
suppressMessages(library(tidyr))
set.seed(1234)
N <- 100
iseq <- seq(5, 50, by = 5)
res <- lapply(iseq,  function(n) {
  S <- crossprod(matrix(rnorm(N*n), N, n))/N
  runTime <- microbenchmark(JacobiR(S), Jacobi(S), eigen(S), times = 20)
  c(n = n, with(runTime, tapply(time, expr, median))/1000)
}) %>% 
  do.call(rbind, .) %>% 
  as.data.frame %>% 
  gather(key = expr, value = time, `JacobiR(S)`, `Jacobi(S)`, `eigen(S)`)

suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(res) + aes(x = n, y = log10(time), colour = expr) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") + xlab("matrix size") +
  ylab(expression(log[10]("median run time in milliseconds")))
```

### R

This includes the interface to the `Rcpp` function.

                    only.values = FALSE,
                    eps = if(!only.values) .Machine$double.eps else
                      sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)) {
  if(!symmetric) 
    stop("only real symmetric matrices are allowed")
  n <- nrow(x)
  H <- if(only.values) NULL else diag(n)
  eps <- max(eps, .Machine$double.eps)

  if(n > 1) {
    lt <- which(lower.tri(x))

    repeat {
      k <- lt[which.max(abs(x[lt]))]  ## the matrix element
      j <- floor(1 + (k - 2)/(n + 1)) ## the column
      i <- k - n * (j - 1)            ## the row

      if(abs(x[i, j]) < eps) break

      Si <- x[, i]
      Sj <- x[, j]

      theta <- 0.5*atan2(2*Si[j], Sj[j] - Si[i])
      c <- cos(theta)
      s <- sin(theta)

      x[i, ] <- x[, i] <- c*Si - s*Sj
      x[j, ] <- x[, j] <- s*Si + c*Sj
      x[i,j] <- x[j,i] <- 0
      x[i,i] <- c^2*Si[i] - 2*s*c*Si[j] + s^2*Sj[j]
      x[j,j] <- s^2*Si[i] + 2*s*c*Si[j] + c^2*Sj[j]
      if(!only.values) {
        Hi <- H[, i]
        H[, i] <- c*Hi - s*H[, j]
        H[, j] <- s*Hi + c*H[, j]
      }
    }
  }
  list(values = as.vector(diag(x)), vectors = H)
}

### Rcpp

We begin with one helper function:

```
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

NumericMatrix Ident(int n) // not exported.
{
    NumericMatrix I(n, n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) I(i, i) = 1.0;
    return I;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
List JacobiCpp(NumericMatrix x, bool only_values = false, double eps = 0.0)
{
    NumericMatrix S(clone(x));
    int nr = S.nrow();
    bool vectors = !only_values;
    NumericMatrix H;

    if(vectors) {
      H = Ident(nr);
    }

    double eps0 =  as<double>((as<List>(Environment::base_env()[".Machine"]))["double.eps"]);
    double tol = eps > eps0 ? eps : eps0;  // i.e. no lower than .Machine$double.eps
    if(only_values & (eps == 0.0)) tol = sqrt(tol); // a lower accuracy is adequate here.

    while(true) {
	    double maxS = 0.0;
	    int i=0, j=0;
	    for(int row = 1; row < nr; row++) {  // find value & position of maximum |off-diagonal|
	        for(int col = 0; col < row; col++) {
	        	double val = fabs(S(row, col));
		        if(maxS < val) {
		          maxS = val;
		          i = row;
		          j = col;
	        	}
	       }
	    }
	    if(maxS <= tol) break;

	    NumericVector Si = S(_, i), Sj = S(_, j);

	    double theta = 0.5*atan2(2.0*Si(j), Sj(j) - Si(i));
	    double s = sin(theta), c = cos(theta);

	    S(i, _) = S(_, i) = c*Si - s*Sj;
	    S(j, _) = S(_, j) = s*Si + c*Sj;
	    S(i, j) = S(j, i) = 0.0;
	    S(i, i) = c*c*Si(i) - 2.0*s*c*Si(j) + s*s*Sj(j);
	    S(j, j) = s*s*Si(i) + 2.0*s*c*Si(j) + c*c*Sj(j);

      if(vectors) {
	        NumericVector Hi = H(_, i);
	        H(_, i) = c*Hi - s*H(_, j);
	        H(_, j) = s*Hi + c*H(_, j);
      }
    }
    if(vectors) {
      return List::create(_["values"] = diag(S),
                          _["vectors"] = H);
    } else {
      return List::create(_["values"] = diag(S),
                          _["vectors"] = R_NilValue);
    }
}
```
